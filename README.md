# Weather-Based-Prediction-of-Wind-Turbine-Energy-Output
This project predicts wind turbine energy output using weather data such as wind speed, temperature, and pressure. By analyzing historical records, machine learning models learn patterns between weather and power generation. The predictions help energy companies plan, manage the grid, and improve renewable energy efficiency.
